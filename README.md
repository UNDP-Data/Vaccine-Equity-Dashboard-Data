<h1>Vaccine Equity Dashboard Data</h1>

The availability of multidimensional, high-quality data is critical to supporting governments in making well-informed, data-driven decisions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For a better, more equitable recovery, effective COVID-19 vaccines need to be distributed widely and fairly, accounting for global and subnational vulnerabilities and leaving no one behind. Thus, global supply, allocation, utilization capabilities and cost of vaccines are all crucial to assessing the equitability of COVID-19 vaccination efforts.
The Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity is a joint initiative of UNDP, WHO and the University of Oxford with cooperation across the UN system, anchored in the SDG 3 Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All. It’s a global advocacy platform that makes an evidence-based case for additional global effort and country support on vaccine distribution and support.
It draws available information from existing COVID-19 dashboards and datasets. It combines these with socio-economic information, to position the goal of Vaccine Equity in the broader context of development challenges.
The multidimensional and socio-economic approach to vaccine equity provides new insights into access to and affordability of vaccines globally anchored in fundamental development challenges of debt, economic recovery, employment, and welfare.
