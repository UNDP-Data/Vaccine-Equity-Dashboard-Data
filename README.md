# Vaccine Equity Dashboard Data

The availability of multidimensional, high-quality data is critical to supporting governments in making well-informed, data-driven decisions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For a better, more equitable recovery, effective COVID-19 vaccines need to be distributed widely and fairly, accounting for global and subnational vulnerabilities and leaving no one behind. Thus, global supply, allocation, utilization capabilities and cost of vaccines are all crucial to assessing the equitability of COVID-19 vaccination efforts.

The Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity is a joint initiative of UNDP, WHO and the University of Oxford with cooperation across the UN system, anchored in the SDG 3 Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All. Itâ€™s a global advocacy platform that makes an evidence-based case for additional global effort and country support on vaccine distribution and support.

It draws available information from existing COVID-19 dashboards and datasets. It combines these with socio-economic information, to position the goal of Vaccine Equity in the broader context of development challenges.</p>

The multidimensional and socio-economic approach to vaccine equity provides new insights into access to and affordability of vaccines globally anchored in fundamental development challenges of debt, economic recovery, employment, and welfare.

## Our Dataset
Currently, the country and regionallevel data presented on the Global Dashboard is divided into three broad themes.

### Accessibility:
includes variables that describe the current global supply and its utilisation and in-country prioritisation.

<td>Stringency Index</td>
<td>The Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) project calculate a Stringency Index, a composite measure of nine of the response metrics. The index on any given day is calculated as the mean score of the nine metrics, each taking a value between 0 and 100. A higher score indicates a stricter response (i.e. 100 = strictest response). 
The nine metrics used to calculate the Stringency Index are: school closures; workplace closures; cancellation of public events; restrictions on public gatherings; closures of public transport; stay-at-home requirements; public information campaigns; restrictions on internal movements; and international travel controls.

<td>Coverage of essential health services (defined as the average coverage of essential services based on tracer interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases and service capacity and access, among the general and the most disadvantaged population). The indicator is an index reported on a unitless scale of 0 to 100, which is computed as the geometric mean of 14 tracer indicators of health service coverage. The tracer indicators are as follows, organized by four components of service coverage: 1. Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health 2. Infectious diseases 3. Noncommunicable diseases 4. Service capacity and access See the 2019 monitoring report for the tracer indicator within each component.</td>
